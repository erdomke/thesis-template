Todo for the Thesis Template
============================

- Make sure formatting is correct.
- Make sure distribution task is working properly.
- Split into multi-file document if possible. Check out subfiles.
- Improve usage instructions.
- Improve maintenance instructions.
- Add instructions on changing the filename.
- Add instructions on the `build/` directory.
- Add table example with tabu.
- Explain more examples in the document instead of just having my thesis.
- Add suggestion to alias Waf.
- Add LaTeX links (Wikibook, etc.).
- Add Git links (try.github.io, book).
- Drop READMEs in every directory.
- Mention that imported pages will not have page numbers.
- Add note about not using underscores and unticking "Document structure tags for accessibility".
- Fix weird-looking tabs in approval form.
- Use lualatex when the installation on EOS is fixed.
- When minted supports specification of a path to `pygmentize`, substitute this into an included TeX file instead of generating the shim like we are now.
